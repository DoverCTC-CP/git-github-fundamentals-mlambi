### It should be in markdown language, but I am not sure which one.  I could probably look at the
README and get some idea of what it is using.
This is good practice for submitting a new file.  I will have to do some other stuff
to commit it, etc.

### Markdown
\~\~ wrapping text with these will will produce ~~strikethrough~~<br>
\*\*  **BOLD** <br>
\* \* or \_ \_ will make text _ _italicized_ _ for you.  This * *works* * too. <br>
