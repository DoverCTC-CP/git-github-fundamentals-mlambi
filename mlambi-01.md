# This is a new file.
### It should be in markdown language, but I am not sure which one.  I could probably look at the

This is good practice for submitting a new file.  I will have to do some other stuff
to commit it, etc.

### Markdown
\~\~ wrapping text with these will will produce ~~strikethrough~~<br>
\*\*  **BOLD** <br>
\* \* or \_ \_ will make text _italicized_ for you.  This *works* too. <br>

\*\*\* will make things ***bold and italic***
what if you need a super-script? <sup>2</sup>
